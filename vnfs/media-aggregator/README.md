# media-aggregator
## General description
The media-aggregator is the component that receives the video streams 
from the cameras, and also, redirects that videos to the different 
media-streaming-engines or to other media-aggregator in another network 
node when needed.

## Container details 
The media-aggregator is deployed on a docker container which contains an
Nginx server compiled with the RTMP-module, a Python script for the API 
and also a simple inotifier script. 
* Nginx + RTMP module: The main part of the container is an Nginx server
compiled with the RTMP-module. This module manages RTMP video streams. 
* ```media_aggregator_api.py```: This Python script contains the media-aggregator
API which communicates with the media-content-manager.
* ```nginx_notifier.sh```: this script is watching for changes in nginx.conf, when 
there are changes, the script reloads the configuration of Nginx 
without stopping the service.

The container has two open ports for the different functions: 

| Port | function |
| --- | --- |
| `1935` | RTMP default port |
| `5000` | API port |


## Nginx configuration
The most important part of the configuration file is the rtmp server part. 
When the media-content-manager registers a new camera, the API python code
creates a new application for that camera thanks to a Jinja template of
the Nginx configuration file. If a user request a video, the media-content-manager
asks for the media-aggregator to create a new RTMP push. This instruction 
will redirect the video from one camera (application) to a media-streaming-engine
or to another media-aggregator in another node depending on user's location. 

Here is an example of the rtmp server block inside ```nginx.conf``` with two cameras connected 
and serving video to three different media-streaming-engines:
```
rtmp {
    server {
        listen 1935;
        chunk_size 4096;

        application example1 {
            live on;
            record off;
            
            push rtmp://1.1.1.1:1935/live/example1;
            push rtmp://2.2.2.2:1935/live/example1;
        }
        
        application example2 {
            live on;
            record off;
            
            push rtmp://3.3.3.3:1935/live/example2;
        }
    }
}
```

## API description
### registerCamera
This method creates a new application inside Nginx where the camera can send the video through RTMP. The input of this method is a simple JSON file:

    {
		"name": "name_of_the_camera",
		"type": "360/plane"
	}

The API will add the application into the nginx.conf file and reloads that configuration automatically without stop the service. 

The response will be the following:

    TBC

Here is an example call for this method:

    curl -H 'content-Type: application/json' -X POST -d '{"name":"name_of_the_camera","type":"360/plane"}' http://[IP_of_the_aggregator]:5000/resgisterCamera

### getStream
This method will add a push order in the nginx configuration file. This push order will redirect the input flow of an specific application to the streaming-engine which corresponds. This is the JSON input:

    {
		"name": "name_of_the_camera",
	}
    
The response will be the following:

    TBC

Here is an example call:

    curl -H 'content-Type: application/json' -X GET -d '{"name":"name_of_the_camera"}' http://[IP_of_the_aggregator]:5000/getStream

### stats
This method collects the stats from the Nginx server. It is called with:
        
    curl -H 'content-Type: application/json' -X GET [IP_of_the_aggregator]:5000/stats    

Here there is an example of the response:

    {
        "container_id": "eu-5gtango-vnf-ma-0-4-f0e237c1-848f4fb898-gw9gc",
        "bw_in":"4396944",
        "bw_out":"4399488",
        "input_conn":2
    }

### status
This method tells to the CMS if the Nginx server is running correctly (`ok`) or not (`down`). It is called with:

    curl -H 'content-Type: application/json' -X GET [IP_of_the_aggregator]:5000/status
    
Here there is an example of the response:

    {
        "container_id": "eu-5gtango-vnf-ma-0-4-f0e237c1-848f4fb898-gw9gc", 
        "status": "ok"
    }
